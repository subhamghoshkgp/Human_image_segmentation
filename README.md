# Human_image_segmentation
This project implements deep learningâ€“based human image segmentation using PyTorch and the segmentation-models-pytorch library. It uses a U-Net model (with a ResNet34 encoder) to segment humans from images.

# Features
1.Loads and preprocesses datasets of frames and annotated masks.  
2.Prepares data loaders for training and testing.  
3.Trains a U-Net segmentation model on the dataset.  
4.Evaluates and visualizes predictions vs. ground truth.
